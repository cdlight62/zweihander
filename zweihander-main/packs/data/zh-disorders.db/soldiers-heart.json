      "@en": "Living in a grim world of perilous adventure is difficult, even for those trained to dole out death at the end of their swords. For warriors, this can be a particularly difficult existence. Some are haunted with the death screams of others not during their dreams but in waking reality, echoing as whispers in the wind. Their victims constantly call from beyond the threshold, attempting to draw the insane towards their own doom. The whispers urge these death-dealers closer towards the razor’s edge. With enough of a push, it stirs feelings of resentment and displeasure at the destruction they’ve left in their wake, sending them into a bout of deep depression."
