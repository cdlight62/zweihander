It flows freely like water, spilling over rock, rupturing the ground and making a way where it can from its source to the sea. Untamed and unchecked, it is neither a force of order or chaos; it is a Wind left free to blow whichever way it wants."

You cannot cast Lesser Magick from the Arcana of Animism until you have two Skill Ranks in Odweft. You can continue to learn Generalist Magick. Finally, you may only ever use Arcana of Animism and cannot adopt any other Profession that gives different Arcana types."
