This mirror image does whatever you command it to do, although it is incapable of physically manipulating objects. While the mirror image conducts its activity, you are rendered completely invisible. If you attempt to take any actions which will directly affect another (such as attacking them, lifting something off their person, etc.), they can immediately make a Scrutinize Test to see through this illusion before you take action. Regardless, the actual casting of Two Selves is never apparent to anyone, perfectly disguised."
