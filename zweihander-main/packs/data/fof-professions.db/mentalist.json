      "@en": "<p>I am no mere stage magician! Scoff if you must, but there are powers in this world that ordinary folk cannot comprehend. Real strength is not found within the flesh or tendons, but within the mind. The actual depth and complexity of our psyche are unknown to many, and those who understand this wield Spells outside of mortal ken. I am one of those people, trained to have unlocked metaphysical aptitudes. Even now, I am but a novice, slowly walking the path to reach my true potential.</p>\n<p>Some think my magics are mere parlor tricks. Worse are those who fear I am out of my gourd and want nothing more than to lock me up for my own protection. I can sense spiritual phenomena slowly creeping into our world that haven&rsquo;t been seen for hundreds&mdash;if not thousands&mdash;of years. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what it is, but I feel that something is amiss. The more I try to focus on the feeling, the more I feel as if an oily shadow is spilling onto my brain.</p>"
