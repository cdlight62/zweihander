      "@en": "<p>I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of the worthiest of all endeavors: law. For many years, I studied under another lawyer and learned my craft. Since then I have lived for one thing and one thing only: ensuring everyone has recourse to justice. As a black box, it is my calling to help anyone in dire legal straits. It does not matter if they are guilty or innocent; I must invoke the letter of the law on their behalf. No matter what resentments my clients hold, I shall defend them. I take this job seriously enough that people&rsquo;s opinions of me no longer matter in the long run.</p>\n<p>Now more than ever, the law is vital to navigating these troubled times. The Rebel mob wishes to rebel, while the Loyalists back a king who seeks to impinge upon all humankind&rsquo;s natural rights. The violence has done nothing but escalate on both sides, and I sense that this escalation will turn into armed conflict. When the first cannon is fired, the law will be thrown to the wind and chaos will reign unhindered. Perhaps that is why I feel I must work at this time, to keep us away from the brink of ruin and disaster.</p>"
