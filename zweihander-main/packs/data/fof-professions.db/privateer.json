      "@en": "<p>Lotman&rsquo; is such a disgusting word&mdash;I&rsquo;m not some pirate who lacks decency. After all, the letters of marque I bear ranks me a cut above those swashbucklers. My thievery is legal as long as I poach the right ships under the right flag. I&rsquo;m not bound by your frivolous laws or morals. On my ship, everyone is a king, and we all work for the good of one another. The work is dangerous and challenging, but the thrill of capturing a treasure ship and taking our share is one that&rsquo;s hard to match.</p>\n<p>Many ships fat with ill-gotten gains must be raided, so my sponsor&rsquo;s enemies are harmed. Now with the war in the air, my skills are going to be required even more than before. The seas will run red with blood and splintered ships, and the loot shall be immense. Still, when the seas are silent as we search for our prey, dark things cross my mind&mdash;the horrors I&rsquo;ve seen and the rumors I&rsquo;ve heard in ports of a deep evil approaching. Perhaps even worse things will darken the sea than the corpses of a few sailors, and I pray that a wave doesn&rsquo;t swallow all I know.</p>"
