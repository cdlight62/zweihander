      "@en": "<p>The time is fast approaching when the simmering tensions will boil over into conflict. During times like these, someone must step forward and take on the mantle of leader, and that person is me. I&rsquo;ve learned leadership skills through many years of combat and schooling, and I shall ride at the vanguard of those charging into battle. My abilities and scars are souvenirs from countless conflicts before. It was then, with musket balls flying past my head, that I learned to lead and value my companions&rsquo; lives more than my own.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t become an officer for the money&mdash;most of my funds go toward maintaining my militia, but my real reward is making my unit into one that will be envied. I&rsquo;ve learned by studying the great masters of war, and I have grown into an efficient and effective leader who doesn&rsquo;t shy from battle. My brand of leadership is exactly what is needed now, especially if the rumors of dark things are true. No matter which side I choose, they&rsquo;ll welcome my bravery forthright.</p>"
