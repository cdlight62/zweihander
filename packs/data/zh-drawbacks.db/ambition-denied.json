The rank and file rarely engage openly in such activities, crushed and cowed as they are by their officers, but between its lieutenants it can run rampant, the machinations of others apparent to you connive, deceive and maneuver your way through the ranks. When your plans and connivances succeed, you are exultant, but when they go awry, you fall into a fit of self-loathing and despair."
