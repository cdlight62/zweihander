      "@en": "The Red Death propagates indiscriminately, a violent disease that sickens – and kills – all it infects. Unlike other maladies, it is more insidious and soul-corrupting than any other. It devours both the flesh and the mind, driving even the most level-headed insane with visions in their sleep. Nightmares eventually give way to physical symptoms. Over the course of a few short weeks, hemorrhaging erupts beneath the armpits, around the neck and below the eyes. The eyes and other open sores begin to ‘weep’ blood. Victims of the Red Death tend to take their own lives at this point,  given the grotesquery they have become. Finally, the afflicted loses the ability to breath, with death a certainty afterwards."

If they succeed at a (Hard -20%) Heal Test, you do not suffer the effects for the following week. You may only be treated in this manner once every 24 hours, no matter whether it is successful or not."
