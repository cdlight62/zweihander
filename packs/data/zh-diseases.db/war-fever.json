      "@en": "Borne from epidemics such as wartime, natural disasters and Ætheric Phenomena, this sickness spreads rapidly amongst crowded communities. Soldiers and prisoners, lacking proper medical support or foreknowledge of how to keep at bay this rapacious sickness, are its victims. Generally, it is thought that War Fever is a curse of Corruption, but the truth of the matter is that it is primarily spread by overcrowding and poor hygiene. Marked prostration, malaise and stupor are the symptoms of War Fever – all of which eventually lead to sickness and death. Pyres of burning clothes and bedding are the only way to stave off its spread."
