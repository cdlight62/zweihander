      "@en": "An army goes to war with its men-at-arms, cavalry, and siege engines, often fueled by patriotism or other great cause. This is not enough, for every army marches on its stomach, which requires a specialized non-combatant role – the Quartermaster. These educated women and men, found in all large militaries, martial vessels and mercenary groups, do not handle strategy, but rather orchestrate the logistics of their fighting unit. This boils down to two main roles: distributing munitions or tactical navigation. Most Quartermasters within an army emphasize the former purpose, while the navy Quartermaster emphasizes the latter. Quartermasters have the trust of their senior officers, but they are also able to interact with foot soldiers and mercenaries to ensure battle preparedness. Their position is extremely valued by warriors of all stripes, because without enough provisions or the right direction, these soldiers and sailors are as good as dead. The Quartermaster is more than aware of this position and they take it with quite some pride, though often that can be misinterpreted as arrogance.\\nSome Quartermasters eventually leave their military units, trading in their skills in cartography and logistics for opportunity and coin. An adventuring party is a perfect place for a Quartermaster, as they can make even the longest hike through a mountain pass seem like an afternoon stroll. Sometimes, the group becomes so reliant on them, that the Quartermaster’s ego grows to the point where they believe themselves superior to others. This kind of sedition can bring about smaller food shares over misunderstandings, refusal to listen to other people’s directions and a general sense of ‘never being wrong’. This arrogance breeds doubt and sews conflict within a party, one that can cause their bonds to strain or even break, leaving the Quartermaster refusing to budge in even the most dangerous of wildernesses or waters."
