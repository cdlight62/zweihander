      "@en": "Death is inevitable. Whether it be from violence, disease, or the rarity of old age, everyone returns to the dust from where we were all raised from. The transition into the Custodian’s embrace is best handled by the Undertaker. If Augurs, the priests of the Custodian, most often must deal with the destruction of a corpse if it rises again, the Undertaker deals with everything else – ministering, burying the bodies, maintaining graveyards and distributing last will and testaments. Undertakers are no mere gravediggers, but they do have a secondary role few speak about – they are wardens of the graveyards. Undertakers protect the sanctity of these places of rest, whether they be from nascent Grave Robbers or unspeakable rituals that bring the slumbering residents back to life. They are the first defense against grave robbing and corpse-theft, and they bear this responsibility quietly.\\nMany towns and villages are too poor or out of the way to afford a proper burial, so many Undertakers will travel and perform their duties for free. At other times, they are recruited by adventurers because of their knowledge of the graveyard and how to best rob a tomb. Undertakers are surrounded by death so often, that it becomes second nature to them – some even wish to delve further into forbidden dark arts and foul experimentations. Perhaps a loved one has died they wish to see again, so they seek to revive them as they feel they know best how to handle the abomination. More often than not, though, these dead spouses and children come back different, changed and hungry. An Undertaker who meets this foul fate will learn that death is a better outcome."
