      "@en": "Information is always at a premium. Sizable libraries are scarce, the maneuvers of court are obfuscated from the common people, and even basic education or the status of a war is nearly impossible to obtain. That’s where the Informer comes in. They deal in cold-hard facts, secrets and juicy rumors; business is always booming for them. Whether an aristocrat wants to confirm rumor of an assassination plot, a gang member wants to know when the next gin shipment is passing through or guildmaster needs to confirm the private records of a rival guild, an Informer can get the information from their network of contacts, rumormongers or even stolen libraries. Though Informers are useful tools, no one wholly trusts them; Informers rarely play sides, readily taking payment from one customer, then all too quickly selling those same secrets to another customer. This is simply a part of their trade, and anyone who deals with an Informer knows it’s the cost of doing business. Despite their slyness and double-crossing tendencies, Informers are a necessary evil in a grim & perilous world’s great game of politics.\nInformers straddle a dangerous line, and when the heat gets too unbearable, they will lay low for a while. Many become wanderers, moving every day and perhaps spending weeks plundering dark ruins. Such activities tend to make people forget about them. The Informer has a natural advantage when it comes to influencing potential enemies while adventuring; they have enough dirt and leverage to embarrass even an Orx. Informers are not immune to their own tricks, however. Their enemies love to reveal the secrets Informers hide deep in their souls, viewing it as a delicious cruel irony. Villains of the Abyss see nothing more fitting than for these muckrakers to be covered in their own brand of filth."
