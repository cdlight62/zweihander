      "@en": "Arcane and Divine Magick are both dangerous prospects, but Covenant Magick is an even more vile concept. Those who manage to physically survive the black energies of their Daemon are deemed worthy, thereby entitled to follow the path of a Havoc Conjuror. Unlike the paths of a Black Magister, Dark Disciple or Occult Magician, Havoc Conjurors are considered to be the vanguard of Corruption, fully embracing chaos as an idea. Their powers evolve in grossly different ways, privy to the foulest of Covenants imaginable. Havoc Conjurors revel in their seemingly limitless power, inspiring despair and adoration upon those who behold it. Considered lieutenants to Corruption’s zealous forces (akin to Fell Knights), they are devoted fully to their Daemon. They are fanatical in approach, above all reproach and act without hesitation to obliterate those idlers and sluggards who do nothing to further their Daemon’s cause.\\nHavoc Conjurors’ minds are constantly wracked by seething, Daemonic energies. Thus, their sanity and physical state are always under question. Like Fell Knights, they too compete against other Havoc Conjurors to be ‘elevated’ to the position of Dread Count. However, these extremists prefer to use subtlety and manipulation rather than the overt brutality of Fell Knights. If the Fell Knight is a blasphemous barbarian, the Havoc Conjuror is a cunning courtier – using machinations, sorceries and falsities to first foil other Havoc Conjurors from ascending to greater power, then render them impotent by ‘absorbing’ their essence. As a consequence, it is very rare for Havoc Conjurors to trust anyone and they often see reality as an elaborate chess game that they alone are destined to win. And for the unique few who have reached these heights, they do win – joining as one with a Fell Knight and ascending to the unhallowed, disgusting ranks of the infernal Dread Counts."
