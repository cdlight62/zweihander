      "@en": "What becomes of a person who has lost everything? A life of leisure squandered and lost in but a moment of misfortune or a carried grudge? The Rake knows, for once they lived a life of wealth, if not one of great status, but no longer. Now they rub elbows with gutter trash, salty dogs and scurrilous cads, forced to live amongst the hoi polloi while sneered at by their former peers. The only thing Rakes detest more than the poor surrounding them are their rich and fashionable former friends. Although Rakes yearn to return to their old fortune and friends, if that’s not possible, then as far as they are concerned, no-one deserves to be rich or in charge.\nAs outcasts, Rakes trade in their canes and fancy clothes for saps and leathers, living as both brawlers and gamblers and able to toss off a quip just as easily as an uppercut. Although their journey of redemption can lead them to odd places, the Rake knows that however far they slip down the social ladder, they will climb back up – eventually. Nothing will stand in their way and this is their greatest weakness. So strong is their lust and greed, they will destroy any threat or obstacle in their way, including those around them. Thus blinded to the fate of their compatriots, even those who actually care; this is when chaos of rebellion worms its way into their mind until they crumble like the high society they hate."
