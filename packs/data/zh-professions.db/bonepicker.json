      "@en": "Whatever their name – rag picker, trash collector or street sweeper – Bonepickers know their customer, and claim to be honest business folk. Their eye for valuables, cooing words and easy swagger are boon when socializing amongst the Lowborn. Three things mark a Bonepicker’s arrival in town: the rhythmic clunking of their overflowing cart, their toothy grin and the line of Peasants ready to rummage through their wares. Unloading an extravagant display of trash and petty knick-knacks, the wise will walk past while the easily exploited look on in amazement.\nWhat was a Burgher’s trash is a Lowborn’s treasure, but some claim that Bonepickers rob the dead – even the half dead – on the battlefield, scavenge the streets for items to resell, like wasted potions and the like as cure-alls and supposed ‘occult antiques’ to customers who barely know their numbers and letters, let alone possessing the capacity to see a raw deal. Their trade leaves open to deals with the less upright or less reputable, even with the servants of chaos among the wastes of the dead. Though they intend to trick such servants out of a useful deal, the Bonepicker usually ends up being tricked in kind. Ignorance and pride are the Bonepicker’s downfall – even a genius cannot fool the devil."
