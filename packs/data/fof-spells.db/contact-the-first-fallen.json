Example deeds include blighting a harvest, bringing plague, causing a jury to find someone innocent or guilty, gaining temporary protection from physical or mental harm, harming someone else, killing livestock or teaching Spells. The Historian will determine what is appropriate and help you shape an appropriately devilish request. Then, make a Secret Test using Bargain. The more selfish the deed, the more favorable the Difficulty Rating will be. Success and Critical Success results in the deed being done. Failure and Critical Failure results in your words being twisted against you. You begin to Bleed and gain three Flaw Ranks, no matter whether you succeeded or failed at using this Spell. This Spell requires Concentration.</p>"
