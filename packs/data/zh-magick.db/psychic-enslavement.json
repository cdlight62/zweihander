You retain your ability to cast Magick while in your foe’s body, despite taking on their attributes. However, your original body is left Helpless for the Duration of the spell. Once you slip back into your own skin, the foe must Resist with a successful Resolve Test or else gain a Mutation called Taint of Chaos."
