        "@en": "After successfully casting this spell, a foe who can see and hear you must Resist with a successful Resolve Test or be left Helpless and unable to take any actions. In addition, they must roll a [[/roll 1D6]] Chaos Die at the start of each of their Turns. If the result is face ‘1-2’, growths of fat and offal explode from the foe, covering an Engaged ally. That ally must Resist with a successful Coordination Test or else be caught in a Chokehold (referencing your [WB] in place of [BB]). If the result is face ‘3-4’, an appendage shoots outward for 1D10+1 yards in a random direction, striking an ally with an Opportunity Attack which deals 3D10+[WB] in Damage). If the result is face ‘5’, nothing happens. However, if the result is face ‘6’, the foe moves in a random direction for 1D10+1 yards. If the foe runs into a person, they must Resist with a successful Coordination Test or else be caught in a Chokehold (referencing your [WB] in place of [BB]). A foe who is affected by Monstrous Dimorphism remains in this form, until dispelled or Slain!. If a player Character is a victim of this Magick and survives, they gain one permanent Chaos Rank."
