The Flaming Sword provides a significant amount of heat and light, equivalent to a torch. Its flames are considered to be Moderately Dangerous. Instead of using your [CB], refer to your [WB] to determine Damage. Finally, whenever you strike or Parry with this sword, refer to your Odweft Skill instead of a Combat-based Skill. You can inflict Injuries with this Magick, but they are set On Fire instead."
