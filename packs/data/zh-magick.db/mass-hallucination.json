This illusion can be as complex as you like and can include sight, smell, sound, feel and taste. Anyone who exposes themselves to the illusion may attempt to see through it by succeeding at a Scrutinize Test. Otherwise, it appears real to them – even if their comrades deny it is there! This Magick requires Concentration. Regardless, the actual casting of Mass Hallucination is never apparent to anyone, perfectly disguised."
