In addition, they reduce their Combat Movement down by 9 (to a minimum of 1). Those who do Resist instead suffer [[/roll 3D10]]+[WB] in physical Peril and cannot Counterspell, Dodge or Parry while standing in the Explosion Template. Remaining within the Explosion Template requires additional Awareness Tests to Resist against harm."
