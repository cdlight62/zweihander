If used on a person or creature, they will certainly give birth to something, but not likely that which theyâ€™d intended. Abyssal fiends are acutely attuned to this Magick, oftentimes placing their illseed within the bellies of would-be mothers. Whether you disclose this to the person is up to you, but either way, you suffer 6 Corruption (as does the mother once they find out whose seed they carry in their belly)."

A harvest is very likely come autumn. This can be used on fallow and despoiled land, restoring it to its fertile nature. If used on a person or creature, it guarantees that natural conception will take place and produce at least one child if bred under normal conditions, at the appropriate time."
