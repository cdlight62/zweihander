During this time, you may use any Fellowship-based Skill to directly communicate with Ã†theric Spirits and Restless Spirits. This interaction is not always beneficial: many such spirits are skittish, ignorant, confused, cunningly deceptive or even openly aggressive. This empathy acts as an all but supernatural type of communication; the complexity of which is determined by the GM. Finally, any Restless Spirits present will not cause you any harm for the Duration of the spell."
