Roll Chaos Dice as you normally would, but if any land on face &lsquo;6,&rsquo; they cannot restore their Damage or Peril Condition Tracks until using Alkali as a part of the healing practice. If you miss hitting a foe, roll 1D6 Chaos Die. On face &lsquo;1&ndash;5,&rsquo; it bounces harmlessly elsewhere. On face &lsquo;6,&rsquo; it bounces back to hit you.</p>"
