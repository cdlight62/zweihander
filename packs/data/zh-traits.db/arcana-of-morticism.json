      "@en": "The practitioners of Morticism have a reverence for life and a deep understanding of death. It is the cessation of unnatural endings – such as with Necromancy – an understanding of how time flows, and how destiny affects mortal kind. Morticism is the dusty murk between both that which is living and that which is not; a veil between both the Well of Souls and the Material Realm. If life were summer and death is winter, then Morticism is the fall – a path between where both twains shall pass."

You cannot cast Lesser Magick from the Arcana of Morticism until you have two Skill Ranks in Incantation. You can continue to learn Generalist Magick. Finally, you may only ever use Arcana of Morticism and cannot adopt any other Profession that gives different Arcana types."
