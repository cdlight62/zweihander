These machines can take practically any form you can imagine (e.g. horseless carriage called a rumblebutler, flintlock pistol that transforms into a sword, ‘living’ paintings, personal glider, etc.), of which the GM must approve of the design. You also understand how to use the Ritual of Construct Golem. Substitute Tradecraft in place of Incantation when using the Ritual of Construct Golem, but you cannot Channel Power."
