By succeeding an Odweft Test, the person you perform Hypnosis on is Brainwashed, and you choose one of three effects to occur:\n you remove a single memory;\n you implant a new memory;\n the person can recall an event that has transpired with perfect clarity.\nShould your Brainwashing impose new beliefs that are dangerous, they can attempt a Resolve Test to Resist this effect. Brainwashing can only affect Humanoids and Mutants (including player Ancestries). Finally, the same person cannot be made subject to Brainwashing more than once a week. Performing Hypnosis can be found in Chapter 4: Liber Alchemiae.\n  "
