Should they enter a dangerous area to approach you, they can attempt a Resolve Test to Resist this effect. Once they are Engaged with you, the effects end. Captivation can only affect Humanoids and Mutants (including player Ancestries). Finally, the same person cannot be made subject to Captivation more than once in any 24 hour period."
