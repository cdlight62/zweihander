In the next Turn, they lose the +3 to Damage Threshold, but take on the aspect of summer, gaining total immunity to fire. In the following Turn, they lose their total immunity to fire and take on the aspect of autumn, able to use two Melee Attacks on that Turn for 2 AP. In the final Turn, they lose their ability to use two Melee Attacks on and take on the aspect of winter, able to Dodge and Parry for 0 APs. This creature may only take upon one aspect at a time, and continues to cycle through the four seasons as their Turns pass."
