If the result is a face ‘1’, ‘2’ or ‘3’, they can cause any one ally standing within 3 yards of them to gain the benefits of Demonic Frenzy (as a Legion Demon). If the result is face ‘4’ to ‘5’, they allow any one ally standing within 3 yards of them to flip the results to succeed at a single Skill Test. If the result is face ‘6’, anyone standing within 3 yards of this creature must succeed at a Resolve Test or temporarily lower their Fellowship by 9% for a day."
