      "@en": "When the stars align, demonic fiends can be made whole on the Material Realm. Corruption made flesh, they seek the succor of powerful, Abyssal Princes by enslaving, torturing and abusing the innocent. When discovered, brave souls of order combat these chaotic entities, they bring their physical bodies to lay before their swords and gunshot. Destruction of the Demon’s mutated, fleshy vessel generally banishes their spirit back to the endless pit they came from. However, some willful demonic forms may retain a foothold in the Material Realm. Their foremost goal – to impart their incorporeal spirit into a physical vessel with a fragile mind.\n  Once within, it is a battle of spirits that takes place between the host and the Abyssal Prince. Constantly tormenting their dreams, the fiend attempts to take sway over the host, motivating them with dark thoughts when their host is at their weakest. This war within causes the host to have dramatic shifts in personality, changing the way they interact with their friends and family, driving them towards further madness. Slowly eroding the host, the fiend will eventually change not only the host from within, but also without as the physical body mutates into a chosen form the fiend favors over time."
