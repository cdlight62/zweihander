Given over to this terrible curse, your body must cast aside its skin, as you now molt upon every new moon. Naturally, the disgusting countenance you’ve taken on raises a horrendous social stigma, unless you take great pains to keep it hidden from others. But it also has introduced a terrible condition where your body is constantly half-paralyzed, your muscles revolting at the mind’s wishes to move."
