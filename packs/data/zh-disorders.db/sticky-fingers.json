      "@en": "In a grim & perilous world, one is hard-pressed to feel anything but contempt and disregard for life. Rarely does a happy moment present itself or confirm that it’s worth living. Leaving a black, empty hole in one’s soul, it can only be filled by something – things which do not belong to them. After all, what does a man have to lose if he already has nothing?\n  Those possessed with this particular Addiction attempt to pinch, steal and swipe anything not bolted to the ground. Whether what they nick is valuable or not, it’s not the express worth of what they steal – it’s the act itself. Bringing a temporary sense of joy, the rush of potentially getting caught drives the would-be robber to attempt to steal even larger objects. A crowning moment for one possessed by Sticky Fingers would be to get caught, but manage an escape afterwards by the skin of their teeth."
