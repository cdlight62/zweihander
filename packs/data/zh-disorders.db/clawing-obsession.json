      "@en": "Corruption can cause people to break easily, faltering at the edge of damnation and sanity where a simple push could plunge them down for all eternity. Some are convinced they are just inches from crossing this threshold, and the only way they can prevent themselves from crossing this threshold is by cementing themselves in this reality. What this amounts to is a type of self imposed ritual: an obsession of an action or idea that is the only thread of sanity they have left. This manifests in a variety of ways. Some must recite the names of the villages surrounding their home city over a period of an hour before they go to sleep at night, others may douse themselves daily in fetid garlic water and spin around, while others may have to constantly count items they handle at least 666 times. Whether these are actual rituals passed down through rumor and hearsay or just coping mechanisms depends, but they are almost always hindering, annoying and bothersome. The afflicted knows what they are doing is insane, and perhaps even painful, but in their mind it is the only thing that is keeping them from crumbling away to nothing."
