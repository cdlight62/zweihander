The Quirk immediately follows the Profession&rsquo;s Trait effects.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve bought all Profession Abilities from your Profession, you are ready to move onto the next Tier. As a reward, you can remove your Tier Profession&rsquo;s Quirk, as your character has overcome its adverse effects throughout the story.</p>",
