      "@en": "<p>Who needs performers in times such as these? Preposterous. I am more needed than ever! Whether I hail from the English stage and feel complete reenacting Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear upon these tawdry stages or have honed my performances in the cold winter nights of my clan&rsquo;s lodge, I am a performer who deserves the esteem of my community. My abilities as a singer, dancer and thespian are self-evident, whether or not the fools can appreciate them in these Colonies.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should cut the people a break, as things are growing rather dire. The rising anger toward Britain, the Intolerable Acts and the increased military presence are lighting a fuse that will indeed explode into something bombastic and terrible. However, if push comes to shove, I will follow whoever can ensure my survival. Otherwise, the world would lose one of its great performers, which is a crime I cannot forgive!</p>"
