      "@en": "<p>In these times of troubles with so much at stake, only I can navigate these increasingly choppy political waters. As a chosen representative, I am a voice for the people. Many may not consider what I do vital to our people&rsquo;s survival, but they are wrong. With the growing tensions, someone skilled in the art of negotiation, debate and leadership is a necessity. We may be spat upon, insulted and threatened, but our role is vital&mdash;now more than ever.</p>\n<p>Everyone is divided now, from my fellow representatives to those in the local governments. We are treading through thorny issues with the lives of our constituents in our hands. Debate and diplomacy will set the world&rsquo;s course for many years to come&mdash;whether the Colonies become independent or not. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that negotiation can solve the problems that trouble our people, but I can sense time to bridge that gap is running out. Right now, any other concern of unrest or things in the dark is secondary, as the future of the world is at stake if I do not reach across the proverbial aisle (and isle) to create some sort of compromise.</p>"
