      "@en": "<p>I trace my skills back to an earlier time, well before the New World existed. Though there is a growing trend of taking the old knowledge and using it in a new way, I practice the old methods. The world teams with life, and all life stems from the natural world of plants. Without flora, life as we know it would not exist. I am one of the few who knows the secrets of plants and possesses the ability to unlock their latent properties.</p>\n<p>Recently, I have watched as many plants near my home sicken and wither with a blight I&rsquo;ve never seen before. This so-called war on the horizon is just a leaf in the wind if this evil spreads further, like a choking vine. The blight not only kills but also mutates and changes things that it touches. I have had to uproot many beloved herbs because they began to make people ill instead of well. It concerns me greatly, as I have watched this darkness spread from nothing to a dark plague that will not only consume my harvest but also, I fear, the whole of the world.</p>"
