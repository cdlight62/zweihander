      "@en": "<p>Government, business, farming and the military all have one thing in common: paper. From invoics to letters, to charters of governing and command, all documents require an expert skilled in writing and organizing. Clerical work may seem like simple drudgery, but the work I do provides me secrets that few can access. I know all that people want to conceal: troop movements, bank exchanges, decrees and upcoming events. I keep them under my wig for safety&rsquo;s sake. If the price is right, I may allow my lips to loosen and my desk drawers to open for perusal.</p>\n<p>I have known about the brewing conflict for months now&mdash;orders of war, diplomatic correspondences and government decrees have all passed over my desk and under my eyes. However, there are other unsettling things&mdash;reports of strange animals, prisoners going missing and other disturbing stories that chill one&rsquo;s spine. These all add up to a mystery to even myself, but I am sure that nothing good</p>"
