      "@en": "<p>I am an artist. Without me, the great events of our world would not be seen by the people. It is I who etch scenes of life, enabling printers to bring them to everyone. My work appears everywhere, from the numerous newspapers to unique prints commemorating important events. Yet, my work does not end with the printing press. As an Engraver, I also work in silver, pewter and other metals to bring a flourish of artistry to everyday objects. With a steady hand, focused eye and sharpened tools, I gouge smooth furrows to cement a moment permanently into metal.</p>\n<p>Many do not know&mdash;or do not wish to know&mdash; that there is evil hidden in the shadows. I have seen the shadows only briefly, and even then it shakes me to my very core. I have tried to capture this darkness at times in pewter or bronze, but its ever-changing form confounds me. My mind itself is like a slab of tin, engraved with these images permanently, and this creeping dread has changed my life for the worse.</p>"
