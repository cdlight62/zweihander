      "@en": "<p>Some would say what I have is a knack, but I prefer the phrase &lsquo;my calling.&rsquo; My mission in life is to nurse others and bring life into the world, while other so-called healers only bring death and pain. I soothe fears, bind wounds and calm tensions in times where it&rsquo;s needed. I am a shoulder to cry on and much more, as I deal in the business of life&mdash;bringing it into the world, maintaining it or even snatching it back from beyond the veil of death.</p>\n<p>I have a duty in this world, and that is to protect all life. I have seen firsthand the darkness seeping into this world, and it is more than the conflict between governments. This darkness is a rot that kills everything it touches&mdash;animal or plant, evil or good. It is my duty&mdash;no, my responsibility&mdash;to fight this rot wherever it appears. At first, it was easy, but now it has grown too far and too powerful. People are fools if they think the most significant worry is the upcoming war between the Europeans, as there is a battle for the world&rsquo;s very soul about to take place.</p>"
