      "@en": "<p>The earth holds many secrets unseen by mortal man. Within its fertile ground, the bounty necessary for life grows. As we push the frontier of this new land ever westward, we must ensure we have the most precious of Mother Earth&rsquo;s gifts&mdash;water. I have the skill to divine what lies beneath the soil, and though most employ me for my skills at finding water, I can sense many things&mdash;good clay for throwing, burrows of vermin and even veins of lustrous gold. Some think me an off the hook charlatan, but the results of my labors more than support my claims.</p>\n<p>I did not ask for this gift, however. Though often it may seem a blessing, it is in fact a curse. The earth hides many things, good and bad, but lately, it seems the ground sours more and more every day. I used to find simple objects, precious stones or other sundry things, but I have stumbled on grotesqueries as of late: massive graves, pits leading to unknown depths and vile toxins that devour the land. A shadow seeps out of the earth, and it nourishes a vile crop, one that seems unnatural and hungry. The earth is growing ever darker, and I cannot reckon why.</p>"
