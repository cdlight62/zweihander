      "@en": "<p>In the darkness of a moonless night, I am the one that brings light to civilization. Mine is a lonely vigil as I walk shadowed streets each evening, ensuring peaceful and safe slumber for the city&rsquo;s residents. People take the lamps for granted. After all, very few people even see me do my work if they stay in their houses past sundown. But I do more than just light and maintain the lamps&mdash;I make candles, distribute oil and repair broken lamps. My light banishes away the shadows, and when villains creep about, I remind them of my duty with the butt end of my musket.</p>\n<p>I keep a secret&mdash;one that would brand me mad if others knew. On my patrols, I&rsquo;ve seen more than just stray cats and town drunks. I&rsquo;ve seen shadows&mdash;dark things that some would call monsters, creeping at the edges of our sleepy settlements. Evil moves under cover of night, its dark intentions blending in with its surroundings. I fight a war of my own, using my bravery and my light pole as my only tools. I kindle the lights at night and fill them with oil in the morning so I can provide at least a little solace against the night.</p>"
