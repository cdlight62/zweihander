      "@en": "<p>I&rsquo;ve learned the ways of warfare more than others. I knew the art of irregular war from living along the frontier and surviving everything that comes my way. I fight the way I do not because it is the conventional way, but because it is smart. It makes no sense marching in a line, standing in front of rows of enemy infantry waiting for their volley and then firing yours. It is smarter to use the natural cover around me and pick off my opponents when they least expect it. If I take out a captain, even better. Some say this makes me a coward, but at the end of a fight, my side has fewer dead.</p>\n<p>I earned my stripes in the French and Indian War, or one of many smaller, lesser-known conflicts. I have seen the blood flow in Georgia and Virginia. I have fended off raids, even those carried out by darker forces. Many do not believe what I say, but I have seen ancient enemies that move like shadows between the trees. They are known by many names, but the one that sends shivers down my spine is the secret enemy, ones who call themselves the Mandoag.</p>"
