      "@en": "<p>I chose to become a Servant for one sole reason: to raise my stock in life. The work isn&rsquo;t easy, and the pay is meager, but I am afforded an opportunity very few have&mdash;for I am privy to the dealings of the rich and powerful. People look down their noses at what I do, while others flat out ignore me. To give them credit, Servants are not meant to be seen or heard. Like a ghost, I tend to my duties as quickly and silently as possible. But I have listened to the gossip, rumors and tragedies from my scullery. And I know they&rsquo;re worth something to the right people.</p>\n<p>I know firsthand about the rising tensions in the Colonies, as I hear my employers talk about them every day. Though some of them are firmly set in their allegiances, others are not so sure. I follow that same logic, as I&rsquo;ve heard too many things to believe there is one cut-and-dry path forward. I&rsquo;ve heard other mutterings, though, such as rumors of vast conspiracies and monsters who stalk the wilderness. I&rsquo;m sure some are just ghost stories children tell each other, but who can be sure in tumultuous times such as these?</p>"
