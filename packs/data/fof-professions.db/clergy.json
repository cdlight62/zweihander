      "@en": "<p>I am a shepherd through which heavenly grace and compassion are brought to the world. I have spent years studying the scriptures, attending seminary and worshipping with every fiber of my being. By living by the tenets of my faith, I demonstrate to all that the only way to live is the way our faith teaches. God provides comfort and shelter, all in exchange for our devotion. I bring comfort to those in need, strength to those who are weak and guidance to those who are lost. I am at the heart of a community, providing stability and shelter to those in need, be they without a home or the wealthiest amongst us.</p>\n<p>The world is changing fast, and not for the better. There is lawlessness, there is blasphemy and there is anger. God sits in Heaven, enraged by the cruelty sweeping this land, leaving blood and tears in its wake. All of this heresy and sin stems from the current troubles. The British Empire and its church have its eyes turned toward this New World, and many want to rebel. The shadows are darkening as well, coalescing into something that may swallow the entire flock.</p>"
