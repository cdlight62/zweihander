      "@en": "<p>I see the world through a different lens. For me, there is beauty in everything, and to celebrate this beauty, I capture it so that it is preserved, and others may celebrate it. There is no ugly, for in everything, inner beauty shines. The way I capture this beauty depends on what my muse demands. I might write using language as my medium of choice. Perhaps I use beads and trade cloth to create beautiful costumes entirely representative of my client. Or, I might use oils to capture the shining world upon the canvas. Even still, I might weave baskets, engrave, print, carve or really do anything to capture the world around me.</p>\n<p>What I do not tell anyone is the truth in what you see. I must follow my muse and travel in the direction it guides me, but often this direction leads into darkness. There is a hidden world, one that many see only out of the corner of their eye. I have seen this world and it frightens me. I have even entered stupors while in my studio, creating in a frenzy only to snap out of it and discover my blasphemous, damned creation while in this fugue.</p>"
