      "@en": "<p>I am on a spiritual journey to deepen my faith. There is no more extraordinary task&mdash;no greater calling&mdash;than to expand my understanding of my faith by interacting with others outside of it. Despite our beliefs, we all share in that there is something greater than all of us. To discover it, I shall brave every danger, overcome every obstacle and face every challenge with a sacred light filling and guiding me. To ensure that I am not lured away from my mendicancy, I travel with little, save for that which I can carry on my back or by charity.</p>\n<p>As I walk the earth, I have heard stories and seen the proof of real, tangible evil. It is called many things by many different people. But it is sinking its claws into us, deeper and deeper. There are devils within the shadows that wish to twist those who it can toward evil and consume those who are unwilling to yield. But I know within my heart of hearts that I will continue to be guided on my mission and to serve as a shield to the downtrodden.</p>"
