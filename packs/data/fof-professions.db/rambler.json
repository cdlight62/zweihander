      "@en": "<p>The reason anyone new to this land calls the frontier the wilderness is because it is foreign to those from Europe. Some people may claim to know how to avoid its perils, but the fact of the matter is the world outside of farms and cities is dangerous to those who do not know how to traverse it. It is a place so beyond normal understanding that if ordinary folk walked the trails I blaze, they would flee in terror. I&rsquo;m more than just a wanderer, however&mdash;I explore uncharted areas, cutting the trails and indicating the best spots for roads for those who will come after me.</p>\n<p>I spend enough time away from townships to not care about the growing tensions of war&mdash;no matter what happens, nothing ever changes anyway. I&rsquo;ve seen much more worrisome things in my rambles in the wild, things of darkness and evil. There is a shadow, large and beyond anyone&rsquo;s worst nightmare. It has teeth and claws sharper than any beast, and it gnaws at the bones of the unwary. I fear this beast of pure malice, not some petty squabble between two factions that will result in nothing but bloodshed.</p>"
