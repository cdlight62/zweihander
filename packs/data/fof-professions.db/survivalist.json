      "@en": "<p>When I am in the woods, I have no time for jovial laughter, polite conversation or deep debate. I am here, rifle or bow in hand and a clear eye on the game I&rsquo;ve been tracking for hours. I don&rsquo;t kill for fun or enjoyment; I kill because I have to eat and survive. I stalk my prey, bring it down as quickly and painlessly as possible and take every part of the animal I can use. The beast&rsquo;s deathly sighs bring me no pleasure or any grim satisfaction&mdash;the only thing about this job that brings me joy is the fact that many will eat and live another day.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the results of the looming rebellion, and I shake my head at the folly of humankind and what it will bring soon enough. But I&rsquo;ve seen worse things on my prowls in the woods&mdash;tracks made by no animal I have ever seen, or carcasses eviscerated in ways that not even a bear or catamount could attempt. I&rsquo;ve heard tales of terrible creatures that stalk the thickets and fens of the New World, and I dismissed them as mere children&rsquo;s fables. However, if the stories bear fruit, I will have a new game to hunt.</p>"
