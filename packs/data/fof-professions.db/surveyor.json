      "@en": "<p>Surveying may not be an occupation most people require every day, but land speculators and other people of means find my skills invaluable. I stake out the boundaries of their newly purchased parcels, traveling unexplored regions and charting them&mdash;geographical features and all. My alliances with the Indigenous Nations surrounding us are paramount to everyone&rsquo;s survival. Without their aid, I would not know who lived in what lands and in what season.</p>\n<p>Though both Loyalists and Rebels have employed my services, I can tell the tensions between them are reaching a breaking point. I have my opinions on which side is correct, but what concerns me, even more, is the strange things I&rsquo;ve seen on recent surveying assignments&mdash;odd geographic features and cyclopean structures beyond description that sicken the land. A shade is slowly descending over the earth, covering everything in a darkness so thick it is almost tangible. I&rsquo;ve only caught glimpses of it, but I know that the shadow is growing larger and more powerful beyond the horizon.</p>"
