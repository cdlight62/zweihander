      "@en": "<p>The movement of letters and parcels is absolutely vital, though I admit, it can be relatively slow even as a Dispatch Rider. Roads between towns&mdash;if they do exist&mdash; are nothing but two runs in a row. The less important mail is shipped on carriages that stop between towns to transport travelers in the safest way possible. If a person needs a message or package delivered with haste, they come and see me. The letter will arrive as quickly as my horse can carry me, and I can fend for myself should I be waylaid&mdash;that is, if anyone can ever catch me.</p>\n<p>Traveling by myself and carrying messages filled with private, sensitive content is not an easy task. Often it is just my trusty horse and me facing the dangers of the wild and any who see value in my letters&mdash;and the value is there, there is no denying. However, out of all the open road&rsquo;s perils, it is the wilderness that has left a mark on me. I have seen for myself things hiding in the shadows&mdash;unnatural things. I have heard voices of unseen origin chanting at the night sky as I ride through the forests. Let others scoff at these omens, but I know evil is real.</p>"
