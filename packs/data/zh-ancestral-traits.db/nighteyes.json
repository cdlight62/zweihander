It’s evident that you’re an Elf when in these conditions, as your eyes tend to flash with their own light like an animal’s. This is the first sign of chaos made manifest in the Elven Ancestry. It is enough to drive dim-witted peasants to demand that “the demon be<br/>hung by their neck until the lights go out”."
